This project stemmed from the Capstone Project for Python for Informatics from Coursera

The object of this web scraper is to determine "bad links" on a website by scraping the data to
a sqlite database in spider.py and in dbdump.py presenting bad reference links on a website.

The web scrape stays within a single website and can be re run in the event of crash or timeout.
